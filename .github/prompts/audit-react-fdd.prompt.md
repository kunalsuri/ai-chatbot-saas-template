description: 'Audit React + TypeScript project for best practices and Feature-Driven Development compliance'
---

Act as a Coder LLM-as-a-Judge. Audit and analyze the code in each file of the project to ensure full compliance with recent React + TypeScript best practices and Feature-Driven Development (FDD) principles. Check for proper use of shared reusable components, clean and consistent syntax, appropriate folder structure, type safety, and adherence to component-driven design.

Focus on identifying violations, missing best practices, and areas for improvement. Produce a clear, detailed, and actionable audit report per file and an overall summary for the entire project.
